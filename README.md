Our first project is build a Hellow World page with webpack & react. You're not able to use `create-react-app` script. Made your own template.


### How's?
- Fork this repository and upload it to your github account
- Install webpack and webpack-init
- Create your own page. See this video [tutorial](https://rea-docs.sirogu.com/docs/frontend/tools/webpack/)


### Source
- URL `Learn React` redirect to [here](https://reactjs.org/)
- use this image to `https://imgix3.ruangguru.com/assets/user_uploads/pp/pp_iqo2rc_8285.png` as src to display react logo


## Need to Level Up?
- add an input under the logo
- anything inside the input will be printed to change the `React` word.
